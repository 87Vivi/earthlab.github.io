### below we will have a summary of the components of clean code

In this workshop, you will learn how to write better, more efficient and easier
to read, well documented code. We are encapsulating all of these things into the
term "clean code". You can capture the elements of clean code into 4 main categories:

1. **Syntax:** Syntax is the format or style that you use to write your code. When a group of scientists use the same syntax, the code becomes more familiar and thus easier to quicly scan, read and understnd. Different style guides have been developed
1. **Modularity:** Is your code more "script like" written from beginning to end with repeated tasks. Or does it consist of sections and functions that capture tasks that are repeated.
2. **Documentation:** Is your code well documented. Documentation can range from comments found within your code to thorough `readme` files that describe your entire workflow. What part of the spectrum are you in?
3. [{{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/time-series-data/write-clean-code-with-r/]()**Expressiveness:**) Expressiveness refers to using naming conventions for code functions, variables and even files that in some way describe that that function, variable or file contains.
