## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week, we will dive deeper
into working with spatial data in R. We will learn how to handle data in different
coordinate reference systems, how to create custom maps and legends and how to
extract data from a raster file. We are on our way towards integrating many different
types of data into our analysis which involves knowing how to deal with things
like coordinate reference systems and varying data structures.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What you need

You will need a computer with internet access to complete this lesson and the data for week 4 of the course. We will use the data that we've been using for the first few weeks of
course in our lessons today.

### Produce a report

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-week4.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, include the plots listed below.

When you are done with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `PDF` format (note:
if you did not get `knitr` working it is ok if you create an html document and
export it to pdf as we demonstrated in class). You will submit both
the `.Rmd` file and the `.pdf` file. Be sure to name your files as instructed above!

In your report, include the plots below. The important part of this week is that
you document each step of your workflow using comments. And that you break up the
sections of your analysis into SEPARATE code chunks.

#### Answer the following questions below in your report
1. **Write 1 paragraph:** In your own words, describe what a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is. If you are working with two datasets that are stored using difference CRSs, and want to process or plot them, what do you need to do to ensure they line up on a map and can be processed together?

#### Plot 1 - Basemap of the study area

Create a basemap that shows the location of the study area within the larger state
of California / western United States or united states. Pick a spatial extent that
helps someone from the USA understand where the SJER site is located. HINT: use the
[lesson from week 3 on `ggmap()` if you forget how to do this]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/week-3/ggmap-basemap/)!

#### Plot 2 - Study area map 2

Create a map of our SJER study area as follows:

1. Import the `madera-county-roads/tl_2013_06039_roads.shp` layer located in your week4 data download. Adjust line width as necessary.
2. Create a map that shows the madera roads layer, sjer plot locations and the sjer_aoi boundary (sjer_crop.shp).
3. Plot the roads by road type and the plots by plot type.
4. Add a **title** to your plot.

IMPORTANT: be sure that all of the data are within the same `EXTENT` and `crs`
of the `sjer_aoi` layer. This means that you may have to CROP and reproject your data prior to plotting it!

#### **BONUS - 1 point**:

Add a **legend** to your roads/ study area plot that shows both the road types and the plot locations. [Use the homework lesson on custom legends]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/week-4/r-create-custom-legend-with-base-plot/) to help build the legend.
Or - use [ggplot]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/week-4/r-make-maps-with-ggplot-in-R/) to create your plot.

### BONUS 1 (.5 points): Use colorBrewer to create a color ramp
In the lessons, I show you how to color your map by manually selecting colors.
Use the `RColorBrewer` package to create a set of colors to use on your plot.

* <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/RColorBrewer.pdf" target="_blank"> Color brewer documentation</a>

### BONUS 2 (.5 points): Use mapView or leaflet to create an interactive map


## Homework due: Feb 15 2017 @ noon.
Submit your report in both `.Rmd` and `.PDF` format to the D2l week 4 dropbox by NOON.NOTE: it is OK if you'd like to submit an `html` document to `D2l`.
If you do, please `ZIP` the `html` file up with your `.Rmd` file.
