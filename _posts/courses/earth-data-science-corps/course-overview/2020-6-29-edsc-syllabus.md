## Getting Help

There are several ways that you can get help when you get stuck in this program:

1. Attend office hours (see schedule below).
2. Post your question on the Discourse Forum: https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/
3. Post your question on the Slack channel: https://app.slack.com/client/T013ZA21V8E/C014626KARG

## Course Requirements

All students will need a working laptop with internet to complete this program.

## Program Components

### Workshops, Webinars, & Office Hours

All program activities will occur via Zoom on the schedule outlined in the calendar below. You will receive Zoom links for events through email and calendar invites.

### Homework Assignments

Each week there will be a homework assignment. Use the materials on the website
including readings, tutorials and links to other resources in addition to skills
and concepts that you learn in workshops to complete the assignment.

You can use JupyterHub (which is already set up with the tools you need) for all of your summer activities (e.g. assignments, project). Log in to the hub with this link - https://hub.earthdatascience.org/edsc-hub/hub/login.

### Weekly Readings

Readings are posted every week along with the homework assignment for that week.

### Final Internship Project

Assignments that you complete will provide you with the skills and resources needed
to complete the final project. The final internship project will consist of a group presentation
and report that you submit in `Jupyter Notebook` and `.html` or `.pdf` format.

<i fa fa-star></i>**Important:** Please note that the course schedule and content as discussed above
is subject to change. This course content schedule is not designed as a
contract. Rather, it is
an overview guide to the materials that you will review during the semester.

## Student Expectations
### Hours & Payment
At the beginning of the program, the student and the supervisor will discuss working hours. At a minimum:
* We require that each intern logs a total of 200 working hours over the course of the internship. Ideally this will be 20 hours per week for the 10 week duration of the internship, Friday 6/5/20 through Friday 8/12/20. However, each individual partner institution can make their own rules about how they want to distribute intern hours throughout the program, for example, if they would like to allow students to work for additional hours certain weeks to make up for a week of vacation.
* Interns must submit a tentative weekly work schedule to their mentor. This will be used to ensure that students meet the minimum working hours requirement.
* You will be paid a stipend of 700 dollars on a biweekly basis from 5/31/20 - 8/22/2020 for a total of 4,500 dollars.

### Events & Assignments
Throughout the internship period, interns will be required to submit assignments and there will be mandatory workshops, webinars, and events. These assignments and events will focus on building core skills that will be useful in interns’ future careers. Interns are required to:
* Give a mid-program presentation on their research in July and final presentation on their research in August.
* Submit all technical workshop assignments on time and a blog post at the end of the semester. The blog post will follow guidelines outlined in this document.
* Attend all internship events. If a student cannot attend an event, or will be late to an event they must notify their supervisor and the HDR program manager (Lauren Herwehe). Event attendance is tracked in this spreadsheet.

## Supervisor Expectations
With the program timeline, prior to the internship start date, students will have limited technical experience. The internship is where much of their learning will occur, so it is important that the project be data-intensive and that supervisors have time to spend mentoring students. Supervisors must:
* Provide projects that are data-intensive.
* Have an understanding that they will be responsible for helping students learn and time in July and August to mentor their students. 
* Attend all technical workshops and webinars, as possible.
* Support the students in getting help. Mentors are also learning many of these skills so may not be able to answer every question and that is totally ok. Mentors may encourage students to ask questions on Discourse or reach out to another EDSC mentor or peer when they run into issues.
* Meet with interns at least once a week to provide guidance. 
* Discuss working hours with their students on the outset of the program. While the stipend payments will be distributed by CU Boulder, each school will be responsible for ensuring that students are working 20 hours per week for the duration of the summer.
* Ask the internship HDR program manager before giving interns any exceptions to general internship rules (e.g. extended time off, flexibility in 20 hour/week rule).
* Ensure that their students are attending all events, tracked in this spreadsheet.

## Program Evaluation and Research Study
We will be conducting surveys and interviews during the program as part of a research study to gather feedback on how the program is going, how it can be improved in future years and learn about best practices in teaching Earth Data Science in different formats to different groups of participants. Your participation in the study will be voluntary, all data will be de-identified by the research team (not part of the program staff), kept confidential, and only reported in aggregated form. Your responses won’t impact your performance in the program in any way.

However, as part of the program, all Earth Data Science Corps participants will be asked to complete all surveys whether or not they consent to having their data be included in the study. Your stipend covers participation and no additional financial incentives will be provided.
