## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week 3

Welcome to week 3 of the Earth Data Science Corps! This week you will learn to work with tabular data in Python.

</div>

## <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Homework 3: Due Next Week - Thurs, June 25 (9am MT / 10am CT)

For this assignment, you will work through self-paced exercises that introduce core concepts in Python programming including:
* Complete the readings below which review common spatial data types and formats that you can use in Python to complete scientific analyses, including spatial vector data and raster data.
* Complete Jupyter Notebooks that review the various data types


### Readings

* <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-vector-data-python/spatial-data-vector-shapefiles/">Introduction to Spatial Vector Data:</a> Chapter 2 in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook.  

* <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-vector-data-python/vector-data-processing/">Introduction to Processing Spatial vector Data with GeoPandas:</a> Chapter 3 in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

* <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-raster-data-python/fundamentals-raster-data/">Introduction to Raster Data:</a> Chapter 4 in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

* <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-raster-data-python/raster-data-processing/">Introduction to Data Processing:</a> Chapter 5 in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

If you would like to follow the code in the readings, you can use <a href="https://hub.earthdatascience.org/edsc-hub/hub/login">the JupyterHub environment</a> which is accessible via a web browser with an active internet connection. Recall that you need to use your GitHub account to login.  You can also use your local computer if you have successfully <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/">set-up your local computing environment</a>.
