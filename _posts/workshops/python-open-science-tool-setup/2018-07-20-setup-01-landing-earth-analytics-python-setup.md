Welcome to week one of Earth Analytics! In week 1 we will explore data together
in class related to the 2013 Colorado Floods. In your homework, you will set up
`Python` and `Jupyter Notebook` on your laptop and learn how to create an Jupyter Notebook
document and convert it to an .html.

Please review the lessons in this section to get your computer setup for working on class activities.
Important: We also have a cloud environment available for you to use for your homework assignments. However we encourage you to practice getting things setup on your own computer as well as it's a good skill to have!
