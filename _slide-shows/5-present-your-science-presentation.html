## Structure of a science talk

* Introduce yourself
* Background:
   * What are you studying?
   * Why should the audience care?
   * Include a study area context map!
* Methods: What was your approach?
* **Important** Results:
* Conclusions / next steps

## 1. Introduce yourself

* Name, science background, major
* Present your topic, clearly and concisely.

???
It is important to present yourself with confidence. Convince the audience that
they should listen to you. Be sure to tell your audience who you are! In this case, include your major and
your science background / interests

Clearly present what topic or question you are researching. Everyone in the room
should be able to describe your topic to someone else even if it's just in
one sentence.

# Background

???
It is important to present yourself with confidence. Convince the audience that
they should listen to you.

class: center, middle

## Why Should Your Audience Care?

* Tell the audience why your topic is important - *to them* and others.
* Provide a summary of what has already been done on this topic - context

*A good background overview requires a literature review*

.outline-header[background]

???
It is important to convince the audience that your topic is important. Make them
care about the topic - concisely explain why it is relevant to them.

Note that the audience that you are presenting to will determine in part how
you explain the important.

Examples: if you are presenting to a group of policy makers about climate, you
may emphasize  components that might impact both people, getting their constintuents
support,etc. If you are presenting to a bunch of farmers, you may link climate to
impacts on their farms, business, etc.

## TOPIC: Impact of Climate Change on Precipitation & Drought

> Audience: other scientists:
> What is your message?

???
You are presenting the impacts of changes in climate on preipitation and draught
to your scientific peers. What is your key message? What points do you cover?

class: center, middle

## TOPIC: Impact of Climate Change on Precipitation & Drought

> Audience: farmers
>
> What is your message?

???
How would your message change if you were presenting to say a group of farmers
or landowners compared to scientists? What things might be the most important?

## TOPIC: Impact of Climate Change on Precipitation & Drought

> Audience: your grandmother or mother
>
> What is your message?

???
What about your grandmother? How would you change your entire presentation and
also your message?

## Where is Your Study Area?

???
Does this image tell you where this person is working?
Don't just start "zoomed in". Give your audience context of where you are working.

## Part 2: Methods

class: middle

.outline-header[methods]

## Get To The Point

* Present your methods CONCISELY.
* SUMMARIZE key method steps.
* Avoid too many details

???
Don't walk your audience through every step of the process. You don't have time and your
audience will get bored. Summarize key steps.

Your audience will get lost with too many details. Consider what is the most important
and consider how much time you have to present.

## What Data Will You Use?

* Be sure to clearly articulate the data that you plan to use
* Also briefly mention any challenges that you anticipate with getting the data.

IMPORTANT: you should have looked into your data sources PRIOR to this presentation.
A list of sources is not enough.

???
While I don't expect you to have the entire project figured out, I do expect
that you have looked into the data and know that you can access it. We will
grade you on whether you have explored the data or not (ie that you know you
can get the data that you need and that you know how you'll work with it)!

## Results & Conclusions

---
class: center, middle

.outline-header[results]

## Emphasize the most important things

* Present 2-3 most important findings
* Explain why these findings are important
* What are the next steps?

???
Remember that in general, people don't remember lots of details. In a presentation
your goal should be that they walk away with 2-4 key points. It's not a lot but
would you rather them walk away with nothing or a few key points and your contact
information?

## Best Practices for Slides

* Keep graphics simple
* Make axis labels and titles large enought to read
* Consider those in sitting in the back of the room!

???
Don't include graphics that are overly complex. Be sure to increase the font
size on axis labels and titles.

---
class: middle

.outline-header[slide best practices]

## Whenever you present a graphic

* Tell your audience what is on the x and y axis. Don't make them figure it out!
* Explain any colors / legend values used

???
Don't include graphics that are overly complex. Be sure to increase the font
size on axis labels and titles. Then walk your audience through all of the elements
of a graphic. Yes this will take you additional time to explain!

???
What could you do to make this graphic more self-explanatory?

???
*What about this one? Any better?*

???
*How could we make this slide more self-explanatory?*
---

???
Notice that by adjusting the title and fonts, your graphic can quickly become more readable

.outline-header[slide best practices]

## Explain each axis and any colors used

* Walk your audience through the x and y axis
* include units
* Describe what colors in the map represent (if anything) even if you have a legend

???
Remember that while you've spent a lot of time creating this plot, your audience
hasn't seen it before. Walk them through it. that way they won't be focused on
figuring out what the plot shows - you tell them that. They will then listen to
you more closely!

*Explain the x and y axes and make sure the text is readable. Is this readable?*
