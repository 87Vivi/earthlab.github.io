## Use R, Python and Other Open Tools For GIS

You can use many different tools to work with spatial or GIS data and to create
maps including scientific programming languages like `R` and `Python` and `QGIS`.

The lessons on this page will help you use `R` and `Python`, which are free and
open scientific programming languages, to perform that same tasks
that you may already know how to perform in ArcGIS.
