## An Introduction to Remote Sensing Data

Remote Sensing is studying things without touching them. To study the Earth and
the landscape around us, you can use cameras and other sensors such as lidar to
capture images and data about the Earth as it changes over time.

### Active vs Passive Remote Sensing

There are two types of remote sensing sensors: active and passive sensors. Passive
sensors measure existing energy - often from the sun. The camera in your smart
phone or ipad is an example of a passive remote sensing sensor. To capture a picture,
this camera records sunlight, reflected off objects. A passive remote sensing
sensor creates its own energy source. Lidar (also sometimes
referred to as active laser scanning) is an example of an active remote sensing
sensor. Lidar systems have a laser on board that emits light that then
reflects objects, like trees, on the earth's surface.

Below you will find lessons that cover how to find, download, work with, visualize
and analyze remote sensing data in `R` or `Python`.
